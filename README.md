# Medical_Chatbot
A Medical Chatbot built with LangChain, Pinecone, and Flask that answers healthcare-related queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It runs locally on localhost, embedding a medical reference book into a vector database to provide accurate, context-aware, and privacy-friendly responses.
